# Burger Devourer!

**Overview**

Burger Devourer! is an interactive application which allows users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the application will display the burger on the page waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devoured!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The application will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

***Technology***

    - JavaScript
    - CSS
    - Node.js
    - Express.js
    - Handlebars.js
    - MySQL
    - ORM(individually created)
    - MVC

**Objective**

My goal was to create an interactive mobile friendly application that would be unique and engaging to the individual user. I also wanted to gain a better understanding of Handlebars, MySQL, and create my own ORM. 

**Future Goals**

I would like to continue improving the styling and possibly encorporate the use of an API to track the locations of particular burgers and the restaurants where they are served.
